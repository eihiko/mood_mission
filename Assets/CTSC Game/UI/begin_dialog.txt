Although your village has always been a safe haven, things have changed in the surrounding areas. You have heard stories of dragons and strange creatures moving into neighboring towns and you have seen fleeing townspeople in the woods, sometimes begging for food. Everyone in your village lives in fear of the day when the creatures will intrude into your village and life will be forever changed. 
You have heard stories of a great warrior named Torkana who has been traveling from town to town battling the dragon and other creatures. Lore says that Torkana lives out in the woods alone, but few have seen his hut and its location is unknown.
As you walk home from school, you are preoccupied by worries about your uncle, who lives in the neighboring village of Merami. You have heard that Merami is being overrun by creatures. It has been over a week since you have heard from your uncle and you do not even know if he is still alive. You look up and realize that you missed a turn to go home and wandered deeper into the woods than you have ever been. You enter a clearing and see a little hut. A person emerges from the hut and walks to a pile of firewood a short distance from the hut, then sees you and greets you wearily.
Torkana: I wonder if I could ask you to help me by gathering firewood out in my backyard. I just arrived home from a long journey, and I am too weak and injured to lift it myself. My name is Torkana. If you could please pick up that firewood and bring it into my hut, I would be most grateful.
I was just in the town of Merami. A dragon and other creatures have taken over the town, and the villagers are in great need of assistance. Unfortunately I was injured in battle and was barely able to make it back here alive. I fear that I am not well enough to continue to battle these creatures. I do not know what will become of the townspeople if the creatures are left unchecked. Every village and town in the area will become uninhabitable. Everything that we hold dear will be destroyed.
Torkana: Please, put down the wood. It is so heavy, but you are obviously quite strong, much like I was in my younger days. In fact, you remind me of myself at your age. I wonder if you might be willing to help me a bit more by accompanying me on a journey to a town through the forest. The town is called Merami, where a dragon has lately inhabited the surrounding areas of. We must battle the dragon before creatures have overrun the city. The journey will require bravery and quick thinking, but from what I have seen of you, you will be brave enough to handle the challenge.
I will stoke the fire so we can warm up before our journey. While I am doing that, would you please go down to my cellar? There are some tools down there that would be useful to you on the quest. I have locked them all in a chest in the back room of the basement. The key to the chest is somewhere in the back room. It is dark down there so take this candle to light your way.
And so your adventure begins…
You candle has blown out due to the cold draft down here. You should try to relight it. Matches may be useful but watch out for spiders!
Torkana said he wanted you to gather supplies from a chest but mentioned it was locked. Try looking around in the back room for the key.
Now open the chest!
Torkana: Excellent job! You have demonstrated courage, intelligence, kindness and perseverance—all characteristics that will serve you well as you continue on this journey.
When you are prepared, we will head to Merami. I will meet you outside.
We are headed off to Merami, but first I would like to give you this map.
The map covers the whole area that you should need to reach to defeat the dragon.
Torkana: I see you have lost your map due to the wind. You must search for it down at the bottom of the hill. 
There may be some bees down there, but they're the type that don't sting.  You should choose to tolerate them and they will eventually ignore you.
Torkana said you should tolerate the bees, so focus on trying to find the map if you can.
Torkana: You were really brave down there. I am proud of you for tolerating the bees and retrieving the map. 
How about we go to the Doctor’s office closer to Merami and get ourselves healed? Let’s walk together to the doctor’s office now.
Torkana: Hi Doctor! I’m here because was injured in a recent battle. I’m afraid it’s getting worse. 
Can you take a look at my wounds?
Doctor: Yes, you are in rough shape. Good thing you came to my office today. We have had a bee problem around here. I have just the herb you need out back in my garden. There is a healing cave with special water too.
Would you be willing to get both so I can heal you up?
Torkana: You should get the herbs and water so the doctor can heal my wounds.
His garden is right out back, but the healing cave is hidden. I have faith you can find it. Watch out for more bees out there. If you see them, remember to tolerate them and they will ignore you.
Torkana said to tolerate the bees so they ignore you. You need to find the special herb from the healing cave the doctor spoke of. Try find the cave entrance nearby. 
Keep an eye out for the herb and the cave entrance.
You are close to the herb, now grab it!
The bees will not follow you into the healing cave. You need to find the special water in there. The cave entrance should be around here somewhere, look near the torches over there.
As the Doctor said, you must search for the healing water pool in the cave.
You have a low amount of health and will not be able to bear anymore threats. You must find a healing potion somewhere in the cave now.
Now you must apply the potion by clicking the drop-down inventory and selecting the potion.
You are ready to return to the Doctor’s Office. Find your way back so that the Doctor can help you and Torkana as soon as possible.
Doctor: Look who is back! Torkana and I are very happy to see you. We hope that you have successfully found the necessary supplies to heal him.
If you have found the herbs and healing water, please give them to me now.
Torkana: Thank you for finding the medicine for me. I hope the healing cave was not too terrifying or confusing. I plan to give you something after the Doctor heals me. 
Please, sit down at the chair to your left and rest.
Doctor: Unfortunately, Torkana's injuries will take a little longer to heal.  He won't be able to travel with you to Merami.
Torkana: I wanted to give you this magical amulet. It will be your guiding light for the rest of your journey, since I cannot come with you. I hope your trip to Merami is an exciting learning experience that you can manage. There will be hardships, but do not let these overcome you.
Take this amulet and allow it to guide you at rough times.
Now that you have the amulet, you can head off on your journey. Merami is highlighted on your map, so you should not have trouble finding it.
According to the map, the city is over the ridge to the right of the house.
Townsperson: Please help me! A creature bit me and the poison is entering my veins. I need water to clean the wound and remove the poison but I can’t stand up to get to the tavern. 
Could you please bring some healing water to me as quickly as possible?
Townsperson: Thank you!  The tavern is just down the street. There is a mug on the sign.
Townsperson: Oh, you got the healing water!  Thank you!
Townsperson: I still feel ill...  The doctor just outside of town should have more potent healing water.  Would you get some for me?
Townsperson: Thank you for your help. I’m feeling better already!
What brings you to Merami?
You explain your quest to find Torkana and the adventures you have had already.
Townsperson: Yes, what Torkana told you is true. Many people have fled the town because they’re afraid of the dragon and the creatures.
In the house on top of the hill down the street lives the son of the man who built the sewer system. His father went into the sewers to try to get rid of a big creature that has taken over the sewers and he never returned.
If you want to strike at the heart of the creatures, you need to defeat the dragon, but no one knows how to get to the island where it lives. I suggest you go try to find the Sewer Foreman in the sewer where he works.
The townsperson said the son of the foreman lives in the house at the top of the hill down the street.  You should head there right away.
Son: Come on inside!
Son: Can I help you?
You explain your quest to defeat the dragon and that you need to speak to his father to get to the island.
Son: My father disappeared days ago. I wanted to go after him but I have not had time because of my responsibilities operating the city facilities and caring for my mother.
I have a map of the sewers but I am not entirely sure that I trust you enough to give it to you...
I know of two townspeople who need help with certain problems they have. If you help them, I may give you the map.
The first one is one with the flowers out front that is down the road from the tavern, and the second one is down and to the right from here, next to the locksmith.
You need to help both townspeople to get the sewer map.  Start with the person in the house down the street from the tavern, with the flowers.
This looks like the right house.  You should go inside and see what you can do to help.
Old Man: How may I help you?
You explain to the old man that the son of the sewer mentioned that he needed help and that you were very willing to help him with whatever he needed.
Old Man: Oh, that is wonderful of you to do so! I recently injured myself moving furniture around and it is hard for me to walk now. My fireplace damper has been broken and the fireplace is smoking a little.
If it is not too much trouble, please go to the the blacksmith, down at the end of the street to the right, to get some tools for me. l will be extremely grateful for your efforts!
The blacksmith is in the house at the end of the street.  He should be able to help you get tools for the old man.
Blacksmith: Hello.  How may I help you?
You explain to him that you need some tools from him to help the old man up the street with his damaged fireplace damper.
Blacksmith: I would love to help you, but all of the tools I had ready are being used by other townspeople right now.
If you help me forge some new ones, I would be happy to let you use them.
Blacksmith: Great job!  We still have two more tools to make, though.
Blacksmith: Brilliant!  Only one left to create.
Blacksmith: You got it!  Thanks again for helping me out.  Here, take these to the old man up the street.
With the tools you made, the old man should be able to fix his fireplace damper.  You should go back to him.
Old Man: There you are.  Were you able to get the tools I need?
Old Man: Oh, thank you!  These are exactly what I needed!  You are very kind.
Next you should visit the person living next to the locksmith.  According to the directions you were given, it should be just a short walk away.
That is the locksmith right there.  This must be the place.
Woman: How may I help you?
You explain to the middle-aged woman that the son of the sewer foreman mentioned that she needed help and that you were very willing to help her with whatever she needed.
Woman: Oh, how nice of you to do so! As a matter of fact, I do need a little favor.
I have some letters that need to be mailed. If you do not mind, please take the letters to the tavern so the postman can pick them up. I have not had the time to go down to the tavern myself, but if you could mail the letters for me, I would be very thankful!
It looks like a storm may be coming.  The tavern is a bit of a walk from here.  Better hurry.
You can hear the thunder getting closer.
Oh no!  The rain has already started.  You should get to shelter quickly before it gets worse.
Torkana through the amulet: You were chosen for your strength, bravery, and compassion. You are not making a good choice, which makes me rethink whether you are a capable warrior.
Woman: You came back.  I guess this storm is too strong to go out in.  I suppose I will deliver the letters another day.  Thank you anyway for trying.
Tavern Keeper: You have some letters to mail to the neighboring town I see.
You: I am helping the middle aged woman that lives in the house with the red door to mail these. She has been so busy lately and I am just doing a small favor. The storm is quite big outside, do you mind if I stay here until it stops?
Tavern Keeper: You are so nice to be helping her! How could I not let you stay until the storm has stopped?
You stay in the tavern until the thunder stops.  You can still hear it raining outside.  Will you stay until it stops completely?
You wait in the tavern until you cannot hear the rain any longer.
You wait and talk with the woman until the storm has passed.  You should return to the son of the foreman now.
As you near the house again, you hear the sound of a little girl crying.  You decide to go see if there is anything you can do.
You find the girl you heard earlier.  You ask her what is wrong.
Girl: I got separated from my parents as people were running away from the monsters that have invaded town... I came back to our house because I was sure they would come back for me soon! I’ve waited for so long but I haven’t seen them...
I don’t think they love me! Or else why would they not have come back for me once they noticed I got left behind?
You reassure the girl that her parents do love her, but she still seems sad.  You decide to see if you can find something that would show her that her parents still love her.
Look around for something that shows love.  Perhaps something she created that her parents saved.
Those writings should do the trick.  You should bring them out to the girl.
You show the girl the writings.
You: Look! They care about what you do. All your writings are out on their desk. They must be really proud of you!
Girl: I guess...
She does not seem convinced yet.  Maybe you can find something more important if you look again.
The writings were not enough.  Maybe there is something more permanent you can find.
These look like picutres of her!  Those definitely show that her parents love her!
You: You are so important to them! All the pictures on the wall are photos of you. If they didn’t love you, why would they have your pictures all over the place?
Girl: I suppose you are right…
She seems more convinced now, but not completely.  If you can find one more really important thing, maybe it will cheer her up.
One more important thing should be enough to fully convince her.  Surely there is something very important here to show her.
This locket has a family portrait inside of it!  It must be extremely important to her.  It even has the words "I love you" on the back of it!
You hand the locket to the girl, who stops crying.
Girl: I had totally forgotten about this necklace!  You are right! My parents do love me. There is no way that they will not come back for me. I will wait as long as I have to until they get here!
(You see her parents come running up to the house)  Girl: MOM!  DAD!
Seeing the girl reunited with her family, you say goodbye and head back to the son of the foreman.
Son: Your willingness and ability to help the townspeople have increased my trust in you, but there is one more task for you to complete before I make a decision about giving the map to you.
I need you to defeat the cyclops that has been bullying the townspeople and bashing things in the middle of the town. We have no idea why he is doing this. Perhaps, talking to some townspeople along your way there will give you some clues.
The cave seems to be blocked off.  Maybe there's a switch somewhere in the cave that can open it.
You hear a scraping sound from farther inside the cave.  The rock blocking your way must have moved.
Tavern Keeper: You are in luck. We are about to close. What can I get for you?
You need to get your supplies here, but you also promised the injured man outside that you would get water for him.  Which should you ask for first?
You decide to ask for your supplies first, as they are important to your mission.  The tavern keeper asks you about your mission, and you explain that you are here to defeat the dragon.
It takes a long time to get your supplies together before you can ask about the healing water.  You hope the man outside is okay.
You remember the water that the doctor let you take.  Will you use it on the injured man or keep it for later use?
Doctor: There is a little healing water left.  Take it with you as well.  It may come in handy in future fights.
Torkana through the amulet: You were chosen for your strength, bravery, and compassion. You’re not making the best decision here, which makes me rethink whether you are a capable warrior.
Now that you've helped the injured man, you can return to the tavern and get your supplies.
Tavern Keeper: Healing water?  Of course!  Here you are!
Townsperson: You have some of the doctor's healing water?  Oh, thank you!  I feel so much better now.
Tavern Keeper: Supplies and healing water, coming right up!
It takes the tavern keeper a little while to gather your supplies together.  You feel bad about keeping the injured man outside waiting.
Tavern Keeper: Back already?
You explain that you also need supplies for your mission to defeat the dragon.
Tavern Keeper: No problem!  Give me a little time to get them ready for you.
With your supplies ready, it's time to meet with the sewer Foreman's son.
You did it!  You made it to Merami by yourself!
You come across a lady selling apples.  You ask her if she knows anything about the cyclops.
Lady selling apples: The cyclops?
Lady selling apples: Oh that dreadful thing! All I know is that he has been hitting things and disrupting everyone here! Last time, he stole a bunch of my apples and I know I’m not the only one he’s been stealing from!
Lady selling apples: A few other townspeople who sell apples have also had encounters with him. I guess he really loves apples…
You mention that you want to confront the cyclops, and ask for some apples to offer him as a token of peace.
Lady selling apples: That's a good idea!  Here, take several.  It's worth it if it means my stand won't be getting broken anymore.  Good luck!
Next you see a kid along the side of the road, and you ask if they has any information about the cylcops.
Kid: Yeah, he’s been hitting things and disrupting everyone here, but I don’t think he’s a bad fellow. I think the guy just needs some friends. People always talk badly about him so I bet he is lonely!
You thank the kid for helping you and continue on.
You can hear the sound of deep laughter coming from the town center.  That must be the cyclops.
The cyclops is breaking the stands in the area!
Guard next to you: He is always doing this! Nobody seems to be able to stop him. If only he had some good use for his club...
You get the attention of the cyclops, who stops swinging his club to talk to you.
Cyclops: What do you want with me, huh?  Come to yell at me some more?
You hand him an apple, which he takes and eats.  Now that you have his attention, you should talk to him about what he's doing.
Cyclops: Hmmmm... Let me think about that for a while.
Cyclops: Why should I help people?  They never helped me!
Cyclops: That won't change anything.  Nobody likes me.
Cyclops: Fine, then!  I'll just keep attacking!
Cyclops: You know what?  That's actually a pretty good idea.  I'll go volunteer to be a guard.  Thanks for your help!
You cleverly helped the cyclops find a good use for his strength.  
Now that you have helped both the cyclops and the townspeople, you should return to the son of the sewer foreman and tell him about your deeds.
Foreman's Son: Well done! I now fully believe in your ability to find my father and defeat the creatures that are in the sewer. Here’s the map of the sewer.
Foreman's Son: By the way, several of the townspeople stopped by to tell me how grateful they are for your help.  They really like you!
Foreman's Son: I'm counting on you to help out my father.  He has been gone for a long time, and I'm worried about him.  The entrance to the sewers is on the street right near my house.  Good luck.
Foreman's Son: Oh!  I almost forgot; the deeper parts of the sewer are closed off so people don't get lost down there, but there's a switch to open them in my father's office.  There should be an extra key in one of the rooms.
You found your way into the sewers.  Now you need to find the key and unlock the door that leads deeper in.
You see the key, but it is surrounded by giant spiders that are blocking your path.
You wait and see if the spiders leave, but they remain guarding the key.
You try to stomp on the spiders, but more come crawling out of holes in the walls.
The spiders rush past you to get to the food you placed down, as if they were expecting it.  Now is your chance to grab the key.
Now that you have the key, you should be able to get into the foreman's office.
When you enter the office, you see a note sitting on the table.  You pick it up and read what it says.
Note: Son, I have seen some monsters coming from the lower levels of the sewers.  I am going down to block them up so the townspeople can begin rebuilding in peace.  Love, Dad.
It sounds like the sewer foreman is on the lower levels, like his son said.  You should find the switch to open the gate and go down after him.
You hear the sound of metal sliding - the door must be open now.
A hydra!  What is such a powerful beast doing down here?  You don't see the foreman yet.  He must be past the hydra.
It's no good!  You think you can defend yourself from fire blasts using your shield, but the negative thoughts are too strong...
You don't think you can defend yourself from this threat.  You retreat for now.
Torkana through the amulet: Are you alright?  That hydra is a difficult enemy to face.  It is good at using your own doubts against you.
Torkana through the amulet: In order to beat it, you must strengthen your belief in yourself.  Think of all that you have accomplished, the trials you've overcome, the people that you've helped.  Let them be your strength.
Torkana through the amulet: You were given special scrolls after facing your toughest challenges.  Those scrolls contain the positive feelings that the townspeople have in you.  You can use them to deflect the negative thoughts the hydra is using to attack you.
Torkana through the amulet: Now go forward and face your fears!  The townspeople believe in you!
Torkana through the amulet: Great job!  You've defeated the hydra!  You believed in yourself and the hydra's negative words could not harm you.
Foreman: Hello!  I thought nobody would ever find me down here.  How were you able to get past the hydra?
You tell him about your battle with the hydra.
Foreman: Wow!  That's incredible!  I'm so glad you came to get me!
Foreman: I came down here to seal the tunnels so the monsters couldn't get through, but when I was on my way back home, the hydra blocked my path.  If it wasn't for you, I would be stuck down here.
Foreman: Come with me.  We should head back to my house.  I'm sure you could use some rest after your troubles.
The foreman's son is overjoyed at the return of his father.  He thanks you for your help and tells the foreman about your quest.
Foreman: The dragon, eh?  Well, you need a boat to be able to reach the island that it lives on.  
Foreman: There is a troll who owns a boat rental down by the lake.  He should be willing to lend you a boat for free since you are helping us out.
Foreman: It's already getting dark.  Take this torch with you so you can see the way.  Good luck!
The boathouse should be along the shoreline to the south.
As you enter, the troll working there begins to panic at the sudden light.  You need to calm him down before he can talk to you.
Maybe showing the troll how to control his breathing will help.
With your help, the troll manages to calm down.
Troll: Thank you.  I’m afraid of bright light, so when you came in with that torch I got scared.  You were smart to show me that breathing exercise.  Now I know how to calm down if it happens again.
Troll: What brings you to the boathouse so late?
You explain that you need a boat to get to the island and defeat the dragon.
Troll: Oh, you are going to defeat the dragon?  That’s very brave of you.  I’ll lend you one of my boats to get over to the island.
Troll: The dragon has an ogre that stands guard outside its lair.  The ogre gets sleepy easily, so you should be able to use the same breathing technique you helped me with to get it to fall asleep.
Now that you have a boat, getting to the island should be easy.
It’s starting to rain again.  The waves are getting taller and rocking your boat.  If you hurry, you should be able to make it to the island before things get too bad, but it means rowing through the storm.
You decide to move quickly and row out to the island before the storm gets worse.
You decide to wait for the storm to die down a bit before rowing out.
You decide to look for another way to get to the island.
Looking around the town again, you don’t find any other ways onto the island, so you’ve wasted your time.  The storm has cleared enough for you to row out to the island.
You have made your way to the island successfully.
There is an ogre guarding the door to the dragon’s lair.  You remember that the troll said to do your deep breathing exercise to make it fall asleep.
The ogre sits down and begins to doze.  You should be able to get past it now.
There are a bunch of snakes on the floor inside the lair.  They aren’t venomous, but they still scare you.
You remember Torkana telling you to face your fears.
The snakes slither out of sight.  You can pass through the area now.
Before you stands the dragon.  This is the toughest challenge you have faced so far.  
You remember all the townspeople, the cyclops, the foreman, and the troll.  Their words of encouragement give you strength.
You’ve done it!  The dragon is defeated and Merami will be safe once more!
You try to kick the snakes out of your way, but more still slither across the opening.
